About
======
I am a PhD candidate and Graduate Teaching Assistant in the department of linguistics at University of California Santa Barbara. 
My research interests are broadly Caribbean languages, language documentation and description, social and linguistic justice for Caribbean people, decolonial theory, sociocultural linguistics and sign language linguistics.  

I use collaborative and community-based research methods, I am interested in indigenous research methodologies and I follow the Caribbean tradition of liberatory linguistics in which I was trained during my first two degrees at the University of the West Indies. 

I was born, raised, educated and socialized in Trinidad and Tobago. I am a proud Caribbeanist.  

I am a trained Trinidad and Tobago Sign Language - English interpreter. On campus or off, you can find me involved in student and community organizing, particularly for minoritized communities.
